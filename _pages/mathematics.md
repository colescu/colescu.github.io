I have a broad interest in Differential Geometry. During my undergraduate studies, I focused on Geometric Analysis and Microlocal Analysis. My current research interests lie in Conformal Field Theory and Random Geometry.

## Preprints

- (Joint with Y. Xiao) _Boundary Compactified Imaginary Liouville Theory_, in preparation.
