I have a broad interest in Differential Geometry. During my undergraduate studies, I focused on Geometric Analysis and Microlocal Analysis. My current research interests lie in Conformal Field Theory and Random Geometry.

## Preprints

- (Joint with Y. Xiao) _Boundary Compactified Imaginary Liouville Theory_, in preparation.

## Theses

- Master's thesis (supervised by [Colin Guillarmou](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~colin.guillarmou/)): _Teichmüller space and Weil–Petersson potentials_.
- Bachelor's thesis (supervised by [Long Jin](https://sites.google.com/view/longjinswebpage/home)): _The Selberg zeta function of a convex cocompact hyperbolic surface_ (in Chinese).
