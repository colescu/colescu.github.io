# Welcome to my homepage

Hi, I am a first-year PhD student in Mathematics at the [Laboratoire de Mathématiques d'Orsay](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr) at Université Paris-Saclay, supervised by [Colin Guillarmou](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~colin.guillarmou/). Prior to this, I obtained my Master's degree at École normale supérieure (Ulm) and my Bachelor's degree at Tsinghua University.

Here's how you would pronounce my name in Mandarin:

- 雨 _yǔ_ [y˨˩], like French _u_ or German _ü_.
- 潇 _xiāo_ [ɕjaʊ̯˥], where _x_ is pronounced like English _sh_.
- 谢 _xiè_ [ɕjɛ˥˩], same remark on _x_.

Here's where you can find me at work:
