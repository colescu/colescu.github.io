I enjoy learning about languages and linguistics. Had things turned out differently, I might as well have become a professional linguist.

### Language Learning

My native languages are Mandarin and [Gan Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gan_Chinese). I also speak English and French. I know Japanese, Spanish, Italian, and German, to various extents. I have also dabbled in countless other languages---Portuguese, Greek, Russian, Arabic, Korean, Cantonese, to name a few.

I make it a habit to always learn the local language before visiting a country. So far, the only exception was Slovakia---it was a last-minute decision since I didn't realize you could take a day trip there from Vienna.

### Linguistics

I am most interested in historical/comparative linguistics, phonology, and linguistic typology. I know quite a bit about the history of Indo-European languages (probably more than I should), and I wish I had more time to read up on the reconstruction of Old Chinese.

From time to time, I [write](https://www.zhihu.com/people/colescu/answers) and [make videos](https://space.bilibili.com/1931761492) (in Chinese) about the linguistics of European languages. My latest videos were about Middle and Old French.

### The Language of My Hometown

I was born and raised in [抚州](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzhou,_Jiangxi) _fǔzhōu_, a lesser-known city in Southern China (not to be confused with 福州 _fúzhōu_, the capital of Fujian Province). The local language is a dialect of [Gan Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gan_Chinese). It is distinct from other Sinitic languages such as Mandarin or Cantonese.

Since March 2025, I have been working on a project to record and digitize this language. The results of my work are synthesized on [my website on Fuzhou Gan](https://fudiufa.cn). (Due to the technicality of the matter, it is currently only available in Chinese.)
